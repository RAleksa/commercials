Implementation of numerical methods in order to solve internet commercials problem

Explores dependency of number of times a commercial was shown and accuracy of showing it to the rigth audience from an algrorithm of showing commercials.

Notation:
- t - time
- T - duration of showing
- z(t) - growing total traffic
- S(t) - required growing number of showed times
- x(t) - real number of showed times at time t
- y(t) - threshold of probability of hitting the target
- omega - probability of hitting the target
- rho(omega) - audience distribution by probability of hitting the target

Implemented modules:
- Tabulation
- Integration
- Solving a system of linear equations
- Interpolation
- Solving a Cauchy problem
